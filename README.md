## NanoParser.py
Created to parse log files from Nanominer to ensure accurate share ratings when calculating payout ratios within a shared nanopool pool.
**Note: This hasn't been thoroughly tested for accuracy because the Nanopool API often has incorrect Share Ratings anyway**
* Requires Python 3.9.5+
* Place this in your NanoMiner /logs/ folder!!!
